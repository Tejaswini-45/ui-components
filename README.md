This project contains two reusable UI components—**InputField** and **DataTable**—built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Project Setup:

  No build tools are required—just open the HTML file!

 Make sure all three files ("index.html"*, "style.css", "script.js") are in the same directory.
 
 How to Run Locally

**Option 1: Open Directly**

- Double-click the `index.html` file in your file manager, or
- Right-click the file and select “Open with” → your preferred browser.

**Option 2: Use Live Server Extension (Recommended)**
- In VS Code, install the “Live Server” extension.
- Right-click `index.html` and select “Open with Live Server”.
- Your browser will open automatically and reflect any changes as you save.

 Editing the Components

- Edit the HTML in `index.html` to add or modify input fields and tables.
- Update `style.css` to customize the styling.
- Add or modify JavaScript in `script.js` for more interactivity.
